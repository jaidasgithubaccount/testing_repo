  "Economic and Social Collapse": ["""[...] going to Reddit for world news (specifically climate change) is the equivalent of using WebMD to diagnose yourself. There is a lot of truth on there, but all you are going to do is make yourself more anxious by looking at it. What I recommend is looking up reputable sources even if a little bias (BBC, IPCC, etc..) if you are really interested. Do what you can to help and vote for who will help the situation but don't let yourself get caught up in the 'mad max in 30 years' scenario. These scenarios are based on a worst case scenario (and even then its fishy asf) where we don't use technology to help what we have and also assumes we burn the maximum amount of fuels. As the U.S. and other countries make transitions to cleaner energy other developing countries will still be using coal and fuels. It is very likely we will not phase all fuels out in time, but we are also developing technology to help it out. All that's left is for us to vote and stick it to the people who are against green policies. As long as you do what you can rest assured worst case scenarios will be avoided (assuming nothing absolutely crazy irrational happens.) And I'm not saying this to make you complacent, I URGE you to make strides not only to improve yourselves but the world for us and the next generation. Humanity has so much potential, anyone saying it's already lost is lying to themselves. Hopefully I helped someone out with this, I struggled with this for the past 2 or 3 weeks[...]""", "Labor critiques + (anti-) capitalist (predictive) analysis."],
  "Geopolitics": ["""Donald Trump skirted into office by the skin of his teeth and proceeded to spend four years demonstrating to the people who voted for him why that was a fucking terrible idea. A not-unsubstantial number of people that voted for him regretted it. Those that survived the COVID and gave him a second chance regretted even more on Jan 6. And that was before the FBI pulled NUCLEAR SECRETS OUT OF A BATHROOM IN MAR A LAGO.  It took a remarkably effective Russian Psy-Op campaign and an absurdly ill-timed FBI investigation to inch Trump over the finish line in 2016. He lost Congress in 2018, lost re-election in 2020, and is largely responsible for turning the "red wave" of 2022 into more of a sad puddle. He is a loser and has proven track record of being election poison.  The last vestiges of classic establishment Republicans are bailing out of Congress, and intentionally doing so in a way to fuck over the MAGA Republicans as hard as possible. There is a non-zero chance that the GOP will lose control of the house BEFORE the election. Either way,, they're going to have to run campaigns in more districts than they were anticipating.  And now the GOP has given Trump control over the RNC piggybank, which he is using to pay lawyers to keep him out of prison. State level parties in multiple swing states are already crumbling internally as the incompetent MAGA-faithful take control, and now they don't have any money either.  Oh... and Florida just put abortion rights on the ballot. Cause if there's one thing Donald Trump needs right now, it's 30 Electoral votes on the line in the same ballot as the single most effective Democratic turnout issue in the country.""", "(Left-wing) analysis of international relations and the international political economy."],
  "Finances and Economics": ["""I think what people don't get is that billionaires' and even millionaires' money is not in the form of cash in the bank.  It is mainly in the form of mutual funds, stocks, bonds and other financial devices that are traded on Wall Street or internationally.  These are not the same as currency really, except cyptocurrency I guess.  A lot of the value of shares is pure exchange value and is not realized until it is sold.  It should be thought of as imaginary or hypothetical money until it is sold, then it becomes real and is taxed, similar to chips at a casino.    The only reason why people like Bezos can be so rich is because of the stock market.  His fortune is essentially a very large pool of hypothetical money.  If he wants to cash out then all he does is think about how to pay as little tax as possible, then materialize an appropriate amount of money for whatever he wants to do.      The deregulation of Wall Street has led to this obscene 'wealth' and to the financialization of everything in life.  There is virtually no connection between companies' share value and their actual worth as a business as the GameStop bs illustrates. [...] the budgets of city and state governments are made up of financial investment vehicles like municipal bonds that are also publicly traded. The endowments of colleges and universities are also in the form of investments.    Everything in our society is being bought and paid for with chips in a giant casino. Billionaires are a symptom.  Not the cause. Occupy Wall Street was right.""", "How to afford life under climate catastrophe: Users discuss their personal and (inter)national economies."],

  "Prepper Tools": ["""[‚Ä¶] a 12 year old boy was out galivanting with his friends and put his hand through the window of a building, cutting his wrist down to the tendons and absolutely convincing the kiddo he was about to die. I used my prepped bandaging kit and Most Massively Useful towel (both always in my car) to apply pressure as I calmed him down and waited for paramedics to arrive. ([For what it's worth]: at this point, this TWELVE year old became fixated on how much it was going to cost for the emergency services and hospital visit.) Within ten minutes of coming to his aid, I was back on with my evening, one towel down and a big lump in my throat, thinking how much some kind-hearted leadership is a healing salve in this chaotic, hurting world. I hope this story helps demonstrate how imperative it is to train for high-stress incidents and creative problem-solving--whether passively through "bad" teevee, listening to experts that encourage a RATIONAL, THOUGHTFUL prepping mindset, or taking skill-building courses to improve your programmed response to chaotic conditions... These are instincts which may not come naturally to us. They need developing and continuous honing to be of best use to ourselves and our community.""", "Weapons, first-aid, canned food, and more: tools to prep for collapse."], 
  "Homesteading and Farming": ["""[...] If you genuinely believe that ranchers and farmers are not collapse aware, you are a complete fool. We live the land and we see it and feel it. We are trapped in an imploding system. Just so you are aware, we are also struggling to fill the fridge and pantry. We are not rich. We are not even well off.   Those commenters who chose to be nasty, get a grip. We are all going down. The whole globe is suffering. Don't be such a dick. I'm only someone who shared their experience, I'm not fucking Elon Musk.""", "What to eat: Trad- and anti-trad ideologies clash, but both agree Big Agriculture is evil."], 
  "Collapse Meta-Analysis": ["""Recently there's been a lot of posting about arming up for the collapse of civilization, storing years of food and water, and how to communicate when the cell network goes down.  I don't know who needs to hear this, but that's not necessarily what prepping is really all about. You can try to prepare for all that if you want to, and plenty of folk do. And then they generally end up with years of supplies that they never use, get forgotten about, or get inherited by kids who decide that dad must have been a little overly-anxious towards the end.  I worry that people will come here, see all the talk of guns and bunkers and collapse, and decide that prepping isn't for them. And prepping should be for everyone. So this is a pitch for prepping for Tuesday, not Doomsday, as we say around here.  What's prepping? Having supplies and skills to deal with problems that life throws at you. That's it. That's what being prepped means[...]""", "What causes collapse? How do we save ourselves (and others)? Users discuss."], 
  "Existential Dread": ["""I had a conversation about collapse with a friend. She said ‚ÄúI have no doubt that what you are saying is true, but I'm going to keep living my life the way I am anyways and if we all die, then we die.‚Äù It really surprised me at the time and I couldn't understand this attitude.   Now I realize that mental collapse has long since already happened, like decades ago. Most people are hanging on to their lives by a fucking thread. Video games, pornography, television, mindless consumption and social media are literally the only things that keep us going. We're like drug addicts that decided to kill ourselves but figured doing Meth until we OD is more fun than just shooting ourselves. There is no life for the vast majority of people, there is only delayed suicide.  Somewhere in there, I think people realize this. We can't imagine society being any other way than it is. And no one will fight to protect this society because no one truly wants to live in it. We are just enjoying our technological treats while we can. Long since given up on any deeper meaning to our lives. And if we all die, then we die. People don't care and deny collapse because they really and genuinely have no sense at all that their lives are important anymore.""", "Users explore and support one another through the feelings of collapse."], 
  "Medical Prep": ["""I've seen a lot of posts talking about prepping for dentistry / tools to perform procedures / etc.   I want to be frank with you, you really can't treat dental issues on your own- and here's why.   Let's say you have a cavity- you're just going to drill it out and fill it, right?  How will you know when you've gotten all of the decay?  It's often 1/2 a millimeter from the nerve, and if you hit the nerve, the tooth will become infected.  Think about how small 1/2 a millimeter is.  If you leave decay, the tooth becomes infected.    If you don't properly seal the filling, the tooth becomes infected.  How will you fill cavities between teeth without bonding them together?  Drilling a tooth without lots of water will heat it and kill the nerve- the tooth becomes infected.    Try accomplishing all of the above, with water, and without having the patient choke or move.  Ok, so fillings are out- what about an infected tooth?  How are you going to remove it without breaking it?  If you leave a root, it will become infected and never heal.  How will you even know if you got all the roots?  What will you do when it breaks off at the gumline and is encased in solid bone?  I could go on and on.  **My point in all of this is to illustrate that you can't really treat dental issues without the proper training and equipment.  IMO it's a waste of time and money to prep for this.**  [...] In conclusion, just do the annoying shit dentists have been telling you to do your whole life, and try to find a dentist if you can in a SHTF situation.""", "Prepper tools for the next big virus, and medical tips for when the doctors retreat to their bunkers."], 
  "Religion": ["""Good read.  I've been reading a book "Opus" recently, which is a recently released dive into Opus Dei and how that organization grew and spread.  Summary articles like this sometimes miss elements of how the Catholic element of the far right has both been a growing force, and also has been a cornerstone for decades of enduring far right money and influence.  Checking the supreme court, they‚Äôre supermajority catholic (including the regressive justices), the push to ban abortion was and is spearheaded by catholics, j d vance is a catholic convert of this strain, there's generally a web of far right catholics at or near the peak of a lot of the political elements of the far right these days, even though most of the laypeople in the movement are protestant.  It's a curious thing, and if they get what they want, I'd imagine the doctrinal differences will matter less - as people like vance clearly show, it's the aesthetics, the connections, and the traditional values these people really value, and in that they have many bedfellows happy to accept them despite significant on paper scriptural differences.""", "Discussion of religion - typically critical of conservative Christianity."], 
  "Abortion, Birth, and Women": ["""This actually has a real answer, and it's a much more interesting answer that I think most people here realize.  It's the same reason why, If you ask a pro-choice American to explain why abortion should be legal, the answer you're going to most likely get will be related to the concept of "**bodily autonomy**," but ask a pro-choice non-American the same thing, and their answer will most likely revolve around the concept of "**family planning**."  First, just to be clear before I say this, I am 100% pro-choice, in all cases and circumstance, prior to birth, I am only trying to communicate a reality here. If you are an average pro-choicer and, let's say, *frequent enjoyer* of social media, you're most likely in a subtle echo-chamber and don't realize that, while access to abortion *in some form* is generally extremely popular among the vast majority of Americans, the idea of using abortion **as a form of birth control** is a waaaay more controversial concept in the US than you think it is. If you don't believe me, ask some pro-choice people you know in real life if they have any circumstances where they do think abortion is immoral. Depending on who you know, you may be very surprised.  For many abortion advocate agencies in the US, it's extremely important to de-emphasize this idea because of how it the idea dampens general support for the right to choose even among liberals. For example, [it's one of the first myth's "debunked" by prochoice.org](https://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/women_who_have_abortions.pdf), even though, let's be real, abortion LITERALLY IS, by definition, a form of birth control. and people outside the US and unfamiliar with this controversy are probably scratching their heads at this, because it makes no sense to anyone who isn't super familiar with how weird abortion is for American politics.  TL:DR, because, in the American mainstream, your argument would boil down to "women can just go out and bang a bunch of dudes and then get abortions instead of taking birth control" and that would dampen pro-choice sentiment even among liberals and left leaning voters.   God bless America, amirite?""", "Should you have kids under collapse? Should you even have a say? Users focus on pro-choice and pro-women narratives."], 
  "(Micro)plastics": ["""Sometimes records must be broken.  One area of collapse has been pollution and the accumulation of garbage all over the planet.  There were many that do this, but one that stands out from the rest.  It wasn't Pepsi or Mountain Dew.  Article argues that Coca Cola for the fifth time in the world has been named the worst plastic polluter on the planet.  The results come from Break Free From Plastic National Audit and Coca Cola took the top spot.  There were over 200,000 scientists that came together, looking at beaches and elsewhere around the world to prove these findings.  The United Nations Environment Agency was discussing trying to curb this from last March.  As of now, nothing has really happened in the area of coming to fruition. The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment progress report in 2022 said that its targets set for 2025 will ‚Äúalmost certainly‚Äù not be met.  Coca-Cola will continue to greenwash its own image and won't be held accountable.
