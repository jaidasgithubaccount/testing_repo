  st.subheader("Modeling Climate Change and Social Conflict")
  st.markdown("There's a new burgeoning theory on the contentious politics market - that :blue-background[climate change is a potential security pressure.]")
  st.markdown("Much of the current research seeks to answer the foundational question -- :blue-background[**is there a link between climate pressures and social, political and/or economic unrest?**]")
  st.markdown("To do so, researchers have tracked key metrics in various regions, evaluating communities' **climate risks**, **conflict risks** and **other infrastructural vulnerabilities** that might contribute to the next (inter)national crisis.")
  st.markdown("My research builds on the scholarship. And I've got a hunch about one, _specific_ aspect of the connection between the climate and social conflict...")
# SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS - WHY THIS?
  st.subheader("Social Media and the Climate-Conflict Connection")
  st.markdown("Foreign governments can use dashboards like Germany's [Climate-Conflict Vulnerability Index](https://climate-conflict.org/www) to help predict what resources or infastructures to invest in or fortify, and where to send humanitarian aid in the case of large-scale unrest.")
  st.markdown("But how can non-state actors -- scholars, activists, journalists, friends and family -- make sense of the socio-political effects that climate change may have on our communities?")

  st.markdown("For most of us, the climate catastrophe is personal. Hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and cold snaps have personal significance; **many of us share our stories online.** By doing so, we're influenced by our social media networks. In turn, we help shape the global conversation.")

  st.markdown("Politicians and bad-faith actors alike are listening and part of these online conversations, too: to the extent we put our votes and protests where our _twitter-fingers_ are, the rhetoric we use online mirrors world we build outside. In short, **the kinds of things we say about the climate may help determine whether our communities' attitudes of resilient cooperation will help us survive the climate catastrophe, or if anti-social infighting will tear our social fabric apart.** After all, social media sentiment analysis has proven a decent method of [ascertaining public opinion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dajour.2022.100073).")

Collapse, the subreddit for 'climate fatalists,' has been known as the quintessential 'doomer' subreddit for as long as I've known of its existence (I first stumbled onto it in 2019).")

  st.markdown("This question has all sorts of component parts, but answering it will require a working definition of 'doomer' vs. non-doomer online spaces: I've decided to track the subreddits' **abusive language**, and whether the comments/posts in a subreddit see the changing climate as more of a **risk** to themsleves and others, or an **opportunity** to make money or secure power over others.")

# TOPIC MODELING - BERTOPIC VIZ
with modeling:

""")

  st.markdown("""The original dataset had 15807 topics; using BERTopic's reduce_topics() method, I forced the model to combine them into 20 groups. I then used a [SciKit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) function to get text embeddings with English stop words removed, and re-ran the topic model with those vectorized topics. The final topic model, saved for use throughout the rest of the project, leverages these two modifications.

# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS - TEXT CLASSIFIERS
with classification:

  st.markdown("""I perform two 'buckets' of comparative analysis:
- **Vector Database comparative analysis:** Analyzing BERTopic topics by subreddit, with the BERTopic 'vector database' built by that Python module:
  - this will help determine whether certain topics are unique to a given climate-subreddit. (Unlikely that any of the top 10 topics in the vizualization linked above are uniqe to one subreddit, but others might be!)
- **Other Database analysis:** This is performed by augmenting a master data structure (pandas DataFrame, or .csv file) with algorithmically-derived classification, like:
	- whether the text contains abusive language
	- whether the text treats the climate as an opportunity/risk
  - psychological state of the user (optimistic vs. pessimistic, trusting vs. distrustful)

a. public trust/the social contract

- Topic Modeling
	- Moving forward through time: at the end of January, I'll update the BERTopic model with a set of new comments.
  - Incorporating controversial topics: my first merge will feature half **popular**, half **controversial** textposts; aiming to get at the heart of topic disagreement within each subreddit.
- Comparative Analysis
  - Comparative topic modeling (topics by class) is preliminary visualized; analysis incoming!
	- Text Classification (comparing abusive subreddits) - augmenting my dataset with text-classification scores (abusive language and climate-attitude)
		- Currently stuck with some PyTorch bugs/weird RuntimeErrors. **Potential Fix:** get my hands dirty with the transformer models. The error I've gotten that halts my work is `RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (638) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1`.
- Final Data Presentation
	- I'm thinking this project makes the most sense as an interactive website... easiest for me to send around to friends/family (my intended audience).
